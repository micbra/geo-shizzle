#geo-shizzle

Interactive Google-Map which returns Latitude/Longtitude of the maps center and North-South/East-West distance in meters.

## Changelog

2013-09-19 - The script now gives you the ability to define a custom width and height of the map canvas.


## Usage

Choose a map-area by dragging the map around (or zoom in and out). As you click the **Get Coors** Button you get returned 3 lines:

1. **Zentrum:** The LatLng-Coordinates of the maps center
2. **West-Ost:** The distance in meters between the westernmost and the easternmost point of the map
3. **Nord-SÃ¼d:** The distance in meters between the northernmost and the southernmost point of the map
